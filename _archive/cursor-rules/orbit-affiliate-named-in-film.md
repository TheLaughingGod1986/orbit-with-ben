# Orbit — affiliate “named in the film” gate

**Hard rule:** Affiliate links are allowed only when the product is **named on screen or in VO of THAT video**. Topic fit is not enough. A paradox quote or generic phrase is not a book title (e.g. “Where is everybody?” is **not** *Where Is Everybody?* the book).

If a description, social caption, seed, or placement would attach a `/go/` to a film that does not name that product — **do not add it**.

Canonical ops doc: `07_Content-Ops/docs/AFFILIATE_MONETISATION_SYSTEM.md`

## Going-forward plan

1. **Long-form:** Each new film may name **ONE** product in the film if it belongs there (VO or on-screen), then **one** `/go/{slug}` in the YouTube description (after chapters + subscribe).
2. Description header: `If you want to go further.`
3. Disclosure — **last line** of the affiliate block:  
   `Some of these links are affiliate links. We only share things we’d still point you to with no commission.`
4. Optional free/cheap companion only. **Never** a stack. **Never** a shop read / “link in the description” ad voice.
5. **Shorts:** zero affiliate links.
6. **Social:** max one soft mention; door is the YouTube film URL or one `/go/{slug}`; no raw Amazon/merchant URLs; disclose once and quietly; **skip** if the film is not about the thing.

## Public `/go/` base (locked)

- Base: `https://orbit-content-ops.vercel.app/go/{slug}` **only**
- **Never** `orbitwithben.com` or `oppti.dev`
- **Never** commit `AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG` / `orbitgo-21`
- **Do not invent ASINs**
- Do not put a telescope, LEGO, or Brilliant on a film that is not actually about that — and only if that programme/door is live

## Do not retrofit

Do **not** retrofit old films or recut unless Ben explicitly asks.

## Current locked films (as of 15 Aug 2026)

| Film | Affiliate |
|------|-----------|
| Alien Worlds, Black Hole, Fermi | **No** `/go/` on descriptions or social. Auditor confirmed none name a book. |
| JWST Thu 20 Aug 2026 v04 | Ben said leave as-is. **No** `/go/jwst-book`. Social = YouTube film URL only. |
| 27 Aug Last Star / End of the Universe | id `REXYxuLOBoI` (**letter O**, not zero). `cosmology-end-book` **only if** that cut names *The End of Everything* (Katie Mack). |
| 3 Sept Europa | `europa-icy-moons-book` **only if** that cut names *Alien Oceans* (Kevin Hand). |
| **007 Neutron Star** (next to make) | No `/go/` unless **that** cut names a product. Do not bolt a book on. |

## Agent checklist

Before adding `/go/`, an affiliate block, or a social soft mention:

1. Is the product **named** in VO or on screen in **this** cut? (Not topic-adjacent.)
2. Is it the **one** primary product (or free/cheap companion only)?
3. Is the door `https://orbit-content-ops.vercel.app/go/{slug}`?
4. Shorts → refuse. Social → skip unless the film is about the thing.
5. Old film retrofit → refuse unless Ben asked.
