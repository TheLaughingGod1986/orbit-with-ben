# Orbit long-form — open, end, affiliate (locked 2026-08-16 · Orbit dosage 2026-08-27)

Applies to every new long and every recut. Reference: Europa v02 · Last Star v11 · BH v09 · AW v05 · Fermi v20. Picture path: `OMNI_LONGFORM_PLAYBOOK.md` (AI Studio Veo world / Omni Orbit-only).

## Open

- First **3 seconds** = strange picture only. No Orbit, no logo, no title, no “ORBIT / Stories from the sky”.
- **World does the science.** Orbit appears in **only 1–2 scenes**, and only when the beat is inquisitive or story-narrative (“you're probably wondering…”). Do **not** force Orbit on screen by ~8s on every film.
- Curiosity by **5s**, stakes by **15s**, journey by **30s** — in the script, not a title card.
- Do not hard-cut A/V through a leftover sting (chops mid-word). Cover sting **picture only**; leave VO continuous.

## End

- Strip baked like/subscribe VO and graphics.
- Hold last **real** picture **10s** for official YouTube Studio end screens (Subscribe + next film when an id exists). Moon Leaving v04 shape: **≥15–20s** slow picture after the last VO line.
- **Never a silent hold.** Music continues over the hold and **fades over ~10s**; picture fades to black over the last ~**2s**. A silent picture hold reads as a hard cut / broken file (`00_Brand/Channel-Setup/MOON_LEAVING_FULL_v04_HOUSE_LOCK_2026-09-15.md`).
- Soft spoken CTA only if it is not a shop read.

## Chapter cards (locked 15 Sep 2026)

- ~**1.5s breath lead-in** into every card (hold the last frame / let music continue) so VO is never chopped into the card.
- **Soft cinematic card:** space gradient / starfield + soft type. Not flat black with a hard text box.
- Quiet music under the card — the bed never goes dead-silent.

## Remint / join tech (locked 15 Sep 2026)

- **Remint = picture only.** Map video from the remint, **audio from the original part** (`-map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0`). Never `-c copy` the remint's own audio — Flow/Veo ambient wipes the VO.
- Normalize every input to **1920×1080 stereo** before concat; **verify A/V durations match** after concat (video past audio = silent-ending fail).
- Bed parity: P02/P04 mixed to the same ballpark as P01/P03 (~−20 dB mean under VO).
- CopyFromBox truncates large MP4s — chunk **≤500KB**, reassemble, **sha256 verify** before using.

## Affiliate

- One named product, late, after the wonder line. VO + on-screen **4–6s** (not a shop card).
- URL only in the long description: `https://orbit-content-ops.vercel.app/go/{slug}`.
- Shorts: **zero** `/go/` or shop URLs. Full-film CTA only.
- Do not bolt a book on to unlock a link.
- Do not name telescope / LEGO / Brilliant unless the film is about them and the door is live.

## Also locked

- Picture flatten: one VO idea → one literal image. When VO and picture disagree, picture is wrong. World plates carry the science; when Orbit is on screen he is in the scene, not a sticker.
- **Ocean / shore POV:** standing on Earth's ocean or shore = **no Earth globe in the sky**. Prompt “shore under ONE Moon, starry sky, NO Earth globe, NO planet Earth in background.” Dual-body gate: one Earth + one Moon, or one Moon only. Gate a **mid-plate** frame, not only first/last.
- Recut = new YouTube id. Leave old live until new is public, then unpublish. Do not reuse ids.
- Length **NOW 7–9 min** (Last Star / Europa pattern). Expand to 15–20–30 only after an 8-min film gets real impressions and hold stays past ~5 min. Older lines that say **~18–25 min** (or “8–12 are stale”) are themselves stale — do not copy live 21-min Alien Worlds / Black Hole / Fermi runtimes.
